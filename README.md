## ðŸ“„ Example Usage

This example demonstrates how to use the form generator.

### 1. Create a JSON Configuration:

Define the form fields and validation rules in a JSON format. For instance:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "variant": "input",
      "name": "username",
      "label": "Username",
      "validation": {
        "required": "Username is required",
        "min": 3,
        "max": 20
      }
    },
    {
      "variant": "input",
      "name": "email",
      "label": "Email",
      "validation": {
        "required": "Email is required",
        "matches": "^\\S+@\\S+\\.\\S+$"
      }
    },
    {
      "variant": "select",
      "name": "role",
      "label": "Role",
      "options": [
        { "value": "admin", "label": "Admin" },
        { "value": "user", "label": "User" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
